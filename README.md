# Rotator

Rotator presents you with a challenge to rotate all given squares to the same
color. Clicking on a square rotates it and changes its color, but each click
will also rotate the neighboring squares to the north, east, west, and south
of the clicked square. To win the game, all squares must be of the same color.
